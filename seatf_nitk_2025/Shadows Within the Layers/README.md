# Shadows Within the Layers
From SeaTF @ NITK, 2025.

## Problem Statement:
A locked vault guards the first secret its key is known, yet unseen. The secrets are hidden in plain sight, but locked away with a key. First, uncover the key from the encrypted vault, then use it to reveal the hidden message within the image. A trail of hex awaits your discovery! Even after revealing the message, its true form remains disguised. Look beyond its current state transform it, and another layer of the secret will unfold. The message is still cloaked, but a simple shift can set it straight. Rotate the letters, and what was once scrambled will start to make sense. The message is locked with a familiar twist shift it back to uncover the truth. But the key to the shift? That’s for you to discover. The journey through ciphers and transformations nears its end. Strip away this final layer, and the true message will finally come to light.

A cryptic message has been buried beneath layers of deception. What seems ordinary is anything but the truth is locked away, hidden in silence, and distorted beyond recognition. To uncover it, you must unravel the steps taken to conceal it.

Can you decrypt this message and get the flag?

## Hints:
1. Not all keys are handed to you some must be forged. A strong foundation transforms a simple phrase into something powerful enough to unlock the first secret. Hidden messages aren’t always visible extract them, decode their form, and shift perspectives to reveal the truth.
