# Pari D Pirate
From SeaTF @ NITK, 2025.

## Problem Statement:
Pirates hum a tune so free, Drums and fiddles on the sea. Gold for spices, names are lost, Swapping guns, swords, & Indians—at what cost? Ships set sail, the deals are spun, Fortunes shift with the setting sun. Who keeps a score of 500 when all is done?

## Hints:
1. Swapping Indians sounds a bit odd doesn't it?
2. If you have the right file, just read it, print it and do "-500"
