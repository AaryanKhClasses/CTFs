# Enigmatic Flux
From SeaTF @ NITK, 2025.

## Problem Statement:
A strange binary file has surfaced, containing what appears to be an encrypted message. However, the encryption method is unknown, and the key is fragmented. Along with the binary, you have recovered a small text fragment and a set of constants that might hold the key to unlocking its secrets.

Your task is to decipher the contents of the file and retrieve the hidden flag. But beware—things are never as simple as they seem. Can you unravel the flux?

You can download the required files this link - [Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14FYc3fGReA-VwVDzIAlFr1u7Wl7Ez0Ym?usp=sharing)

## Hints:
**Ancient Formulas**

Numbers dance in patterns old as computing itself. Seeds grow into streams, predictable yet chaotic. Three constants guide their path - multiplier, increment, ceiling. What algorithm from the dawn of randomness follows this trinity?

**Divided Guardians**

Two fragments, two masks of different natures. One wears the answer to life, the universe, and everything. The other, a checkerboard pattern in binary. Together they shield the master from prying eyes.

**The Vessel's Secrets**

The vessel begins with the initials of its creator. Then follows a shadow of the starting point, twisted by the guardian's first half. Size matters - how many bytes to read? Only then does the true cipher text begin its whispers.

**Layered Illusions**

Not one but two walls protect the message. The inner wall flows like water, changing with each step. The outer wall stands firm, divided into equal blocks. A standard protector, its name found in many encryption suites.

*The inner wall prizes perfect squares, then shifts them beyond the ordinary.*
