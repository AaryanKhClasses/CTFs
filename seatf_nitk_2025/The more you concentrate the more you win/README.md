# The more you concentrate the more you win
From SeaTF @ NITK, 2025.

## Problem Statement:
I am here, infront of your eyes but always goes unnoticed. But today who notices me will be rewarded can you find who I am and get the flag?

Use the following command to run the code: `nc -v 0.cloud.chals.io 15114`

## Hints:
1. Find the island that the riddle reveals. Travel there virtually and listen to the voices of those who’ve set foot on its shores. The latest whisper holds the key.
2. Every page whispers the key look at the title that crowns them all. The gateway to the vault is hidden in plain sight. The competition name holds the answer you seek.
3. An image name holds your key, a cipher hides the way. Decode the message, uncover the place, and let the latest voice reveal your prize.
