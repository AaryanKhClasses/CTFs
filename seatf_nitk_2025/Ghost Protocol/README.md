# Ghost Protocol
From SeaTF @ NITK, 2025.

## Problem Statement:
A series of mysterious ICMP packets have been intercepted, but their true message is hidden within the packet identifiers. Are they just noise, or do they carry a hidden signal?

Your task is to analyze the provided data and recover the hidden flag. The packets may be encoded in ways beyond the obvious, and you’ll need to think like a network analyst to uncover the truth.

## Hints:
1. When packets travel the wire unseen, Look not at what they say, but spaces between. Windows open and close with purpose untold, Even and odd, a pattern to behold. The echo's identity carries more than it seems, In microseconds, a hidden flag gleams.
