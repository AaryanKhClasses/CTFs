# The Three Tipsy Friends (3TF)
From SeaTF @ NITK, 2025.

## Problem Statement:
Three friends walk into a bar and after getting all tipsy, they stumble upon an image of the Mona Lisa. Something isn't right about her though. Are they really that wasted or is there something else going on? Oh, and also the waitress quietly slips a note into one of the man’s pockets, what could that be? Flag is a 10 digit code which must be enclosed within SeaTF{10 DIGITS} during submission.
