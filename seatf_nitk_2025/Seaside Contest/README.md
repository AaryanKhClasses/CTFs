# Seaside Contest
From SeaTF @ NITK, 2025.

## Problem Statement:
It is common for ship captains to communicate to the Light house about their route via Radio frequencies. But NITK Light house has a very unorthodox way of responding back.

NOTE: Flag format for this question is `seaTF{}`

## Hints:
1. The lighthouse is known for its notorious ways of encoding text in images
2. Use base64 decoding and use an interpretor to get the hidden message
