# The Keeper of Secrets
From SeaTF @ NITK, 2025.

## Problem Statement:
A high-security authentication system stores its access flag using a simple, yet effective encryption method. A leaked transmission has revealed the session key and the encrypted flag, but without the right approach, it's just a jumble of bytes. Can you uncover the secret message and retrieve the lost flag? 🏴💻

Encrypted Username: `VHJ1c3QgaXMgZ2l2ZW4sIGJ1dCBuZXZlciByZXR1cm5lZC4gT25jZSBpbnNpZGUsI GFsbCBkb29ycyBhcmUgb3Blbi4=`

## Hints:
1. Think of a guardian at the gates, a name tied to authentication. Once inside, observe how bits shift and align with the key to unveil the truth.
