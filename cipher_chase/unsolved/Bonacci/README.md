## Problem Statement
Long ago, a system was created — designed to remember everything. But memory is fragile… and time has not been kind. Most of its data has decayed, erased by entropy inside a crumbling prime-number vault. Only two memories remain intact — distant echoes from a long Fibonacci-like sequence A final fragment of its core memory code was recovered. Before the system collapsed, it used a secret integer m derived from its identity — from the string it once used to name itself.
