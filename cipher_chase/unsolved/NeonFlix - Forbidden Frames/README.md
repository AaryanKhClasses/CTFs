# NeonFlix: Forbidden Frames
`cipher_chase`, `web-exploitation`

## Problem Statement
The year is 3025. Corporations have seized total control over media, rewriting history one censored frame at a time. But in the shadows, NeonFlix thrives — a black-market streaming hub where fragments of forbidden content slip past the corporate firewall.

You’ve gained access to a prototype NeonFlix server rumored to be hiding a secret payload deep in its system. Somewhere in this underground streaming network lies the flag — but the corps didn’t make it easy to find.

Your mission: Investigate the NeonFlix site. Flag format: ZenseCTF{FLAG}
