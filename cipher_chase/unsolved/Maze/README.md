# Maze
`cipher_chase`, `reverse-engineering`

## Problem Statement
You’ve slipped into a fragmented shard of the Metaverse. Your avatar stands at a spawn node in a glowing data-labyrinth. At each junction, four cardinal gates flicker — North, East, South, West — but the system only speaks in numbers. Only the correct 1234-sequence leads deeper. Decode movement. Follow the true path. Extract the access token. If you choose the wrong turn… the simulation rewrites itself. Infinite paths. Only one correct.

if s is the string which gets accepted, flag format is zenseCTF{x}

ex: `s=626283627 flag = ZenseCTF{0031003110}`
