# CorruptShift
`cipher_chase`, `forensics`

## Problem Statement
An experimental AI artist in the MetaVerse tried to hide a high-value access token inside something deceptively simple. During upload to his NFT collection, something went wrong on the server, and the image got corrupted. You’ve been hired by a reclamation team: recover the original gradient, remove the injected garbage, and reveal the hidden access token.

**Hint:** The gradient was once smooth — a perfect transition of light. But when the upload fractured, every brushstroke slid sideways, just a little more than the one before it. Re-align them, and the message will reveal itself.
