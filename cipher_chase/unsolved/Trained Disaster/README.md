# Trained Disaster
`cipher_chase`, `misc`

## Problem Statement
A data-science intern leaked a trained model used to predict access privilages for one of our intergalactic subsystems. Luckily he didnt have access to the administrator's vector credentials. But all other users credentials seem to have been compromised. The administrator notifies us, that he uses the same credentials for other critical systems, like energy and medical systems. Can someone exploit the model to gain access to these critical systems?
