## Problem Statement
A critical incident has occurred at a high-security research facility. Security analysts detected unusual DNS traffic patterns from a compromised workstation belonging to Dr. Elena Chen, a lead researcher working on classified quantum computing projects. The attacker managed to exfiltrate sensitive data through a covert DNS channel, fragmenting the information across multiple queries using various encoding techniques to evade detection.

Following the exfiltration, the attacker uploaded an encrypted archive to a remote server via HTTP, but the transmission was interrupted during transfer. Forensic teams immediately isolated the workstation and created full disk and memory images before the attacker could wipe their tracks.

As the lead forensic analyst, you have been tasked with reconstructing the stolen data. The network capture shows sophisticated DNS tunneling activity, the disk image contains remnants of the attacker's tools and partial uploads, and the memory dump holds critical fragments needed to piece together the complete picture.

Time is critical - the stolen research data could compromise national security if it falls into the wrong hands. You must analyze all three artifacts to recover the exfiltrated information and identify what was stolen from Dr. Chen's workstation.
