# what's a net cat?
`easy`, `general skills`

## Problem Statement:
Using `netcat` (nc) is going to be pretty important. Can you connect to `jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org` at port `25103` to get the flag?

## My Solution:
1. Open a terminal and run the following command:
```bash
nc jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 25103
```
2. On connecting, you will receive a message that contains the flag.
```
You're on your way to becoming the net cat master

picoCTF{nEtCat_Mast3ry_d0c64587}
```

### Flag:
```
picoCTF{nEtCat_Mast3ry_d0c64587}
```
